# k8s-autoscaling

This repositories contains 2 proofs of concepts for Kubernetes cluster autoscaling, one for Horizontal Pod autoscaling and the other one for Vertical autoscaling.
The clusters are hosted on a virtual box cluster created using Vagrant, you can find the configuration guide [here](./vagrant-kubeadm-kubernetes/README.md).
